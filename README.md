# React Online Editor Concept

This is a very dangerous component that would need a security review before going anywhere near your production code. This is an experiment to see if I could get transpiled code to work in line in the browser. 

Potential use cases are:

* User created components
* "Server side rendering" (Dr Evil air quotes)

If you don't understand why this component might be dangerous, please don't use it!
